    this is during their lowest point - kinda what triggers their character development. theyre completely isolated & their planet is slowly but surely being over taken by vines. this is after detcon leaves them. kiv gets their torso slashed by a monster. the amount of damage and blood triggers a panic attack. "its so painful that its numb, its so numb that its burning. you feel like vomiting. you feel like going home." they call detcon but he pretty much goes "oh this motherfucker" and doesnt pick up. hes still fed up with them. the scene from detcons pov is shown first so the audience has no idea. not sure if they lose their life here or not
    
1. itd be really sad that, even if detcon doesnt pick up, they speak anyway. as if detcon is there. it's the first time kiv is shown with proper speech. even then, they cant say they need help

    itd b cool if they had a system in which when a new achievement or skill is unlocked, it shows up for everyone by manifesting in front of them or in the sky. like mayb whats happening 2 kiv could trigger the new skill "distress signal" which allows ppl to send out an SOS from their planet, as well as unlocking health tabs on each troll in the game.
    
2. this cld happen when impt puzzles r solved or impactful things like that happen

It's hard to admit, but sometimes the loneliness is a bit too much to bare, especially on rough days like this one. So you reach out in the way you know best. _kiv sends someone nothing but the letter b_
