    micahdbg said: hey there! Could you tell me what you think a Heir of Time would be like? As in, personality, powers, team role or whatever else your beautiful brain can think of. *Entirely...
    
2. "More literally, they might unintentionally throw their self through Time early on and begin a “Journey through Time”. As they jump wildly from past to Future to Alternate TLs, helping the Friends and thwarting the Foes they find along the way, they would learn about their Self and the Time Aspect, and from that gain the focus and control they need to travel back to the beginning able to use their powers as they wish(and begin closing all the crazy loops they inadvertently opened along the way :p :p)." THIS WOULD B A COOL INTERMISSION..

    _maybe when the meteor is abt to collide and detcon freezes time, hes sent back to when his ancestor lived in his hive. his future self would have already visited and provided the item he needs (like a key or something) to solve the puzzle and enter the game, which she would provide to him._
    
3. he asks why she can move and talk to him if time is frozen/hes in the past and shes like "oh! aspects go down bloodlines, so i have some grip on time too. every descendant is a little more time-y than the last, and YOU (she pokes his nose lol) are the final embodiment"

    she calls him dettie and at this pt hes already visited her in the future, so she knows who he is and has been anticipating this first arrival. tells him something like, "for future reference, cool it down on the visits, okay? i need you to remember something: im dead" then the sequence stops and he is returned to the present
    
6. this time travel bs is pretty much his first test and she tells him "you both passed" (him + future detcon). once hes given the key to enter the game she goes "dont thank me thank yourself" and is generally ominous like that

    CRYPTOLOGUE: detcons captchalogue. its written in secret code and the item icon is hidden/ambiguous so youd have to find out the secret coed to retrieve ya shit
    

2. the cryptologue is meant for all msytery lovers and puzzle solvers alike. when you store your items, they're obscured by a personalized code and their item icon is ambiguous. it's up to you to figure out which item is which in order to retrieve them. it comes with total safety of mind knowing that your items can't be stolen by anyone. for beginners who haven't yet cracked their code it's recommended that they remember the order in which they put their items in and hope for the best

detcons voice: correct grammar, usually speaks in single sentences. when he's excited he can write paragraphs at a time and go very indepth. not one for tangents. when he's heated his sentences get longer and his filter drops completely, repeating phrases occasionally for emphasis. he usually tries to use his words to overwhelm an argument. generally uses obscure old-timey words like mad[man/woman], oughta, reckon, looney, etc. much of the way he speaks is twisted backwards in the sense that he says things sarcastically much more than he should, like "yeah, and if x is xyz, then ive ought to be zyx!" or "yeah sure [outlandish statement communicating the opposite of what he means]"

    detcon n ceru get closer bc they both nerd out about horror shit & their aspects mean they have to work together a lot
    
1. deep down detcon just kinda wants to stop caring and live a reckless life for once. being around ceru lets him do that!

in order for detcon to time travel he must totally relax and disconnect from reality. its the opposite of grounding yourself - he needs to feel as if reality is water or a liquid, as he isn't moving thru the timeline, the timeline is moving past him. he'll get to where he needs to be instinctively. even if he doesn't think he got to the right place in the timeline, it is the right place.
