random blurb ab ceru that jus came 2 mind: you decide to pull it out from the WEAPONDEX CAPTCHALOGUE. you scored this expensive log from a few connections you had back in the day. you usually throw out all of your old stuff, but this is too precious to waste. usually meant for those in the gore-entertainment industry, you're able to whip up just about any weapon you want if you have the right materials in the right slots. you like experimenting by combining multiple weapons to get some wacky, new invention. sure, it might not work out most of the time, but anybody who says they'd rather not whip around an axe attached to a chain like a yo-yo is lying.
