one of the first times rolsia and pythia ever interact is in the game, when pythia invites her over to her hive to discuss game shit. at first rolsia is tense, even after getting the walkaround and experiencing pythia's luxury, but eventually eases up a little bit (not a lot tho - remember, nearly every interaction w a highblood rolsia has had has been negative). pythia is sewing the seeds of manipulation as she flatters her and starts to lead her down the wrong path - saying things like "you're much better company than that blue boy. he has no respect" or "ugh, why must you be so formal dear? this is just a conversation. am i making you uncomfortable?" or "you're too polite. you need to talk more. i can tell how interesting you are" shit like that. she gives rolsia one of her bracelets/rings/etc. and begins to gain her trust. pythia also talks much more casually. they need to do a land quest together so they meet up n do that - unsure of what it is, but pythia can use her staff to light up the dark and see instructions/what will happen if she does xyz. rolsia begins learning how to use brute force. at the end of this scene she goes up to the hidden room w/ all her drawings and it makes the hypothetical audience go, oh no
