rolsia and robot

  

rolsia saying how she's the bad guy because everyone loves the robot and they do everything right

  

they don't care about her and don't trust her

  

she puts her hands over her face and robot reaches out

  
  
  

she moves aside one of her fingers to reveal her pupil

and asks

  

what if i prove them right?

robot explaining how they have problems of their own and are getting overwhelmed

  

rolsia goes you're going to abandon me aren't you?

  

they say no of course 

  

purple sparks ignite around rolsia

  

they lead her back to the lab with their arm around her shoulders

  

all the whole she's thinking

  

they're gonna abandon me

  

there's no way they're not gonna tell everyone about my episode

they're gonna abandon me

  

although they give her a blanket, she sits out on the porch at night, distraught

detcon has a habit of taking things too literally/seriously despite his sarcastic nature so he feels like he ruins things a lot

detcon and cerulean r alone in comfortable silence. cerulean asks "is it okay if we don't talk? like are you okay with that?" or something and its one of his first big Character Development moments bc he's considering the comfort of others more
