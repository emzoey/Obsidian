the green sun that ceru hasta steal isn't the actual thing - just a smaller portion of it. at the very center of all the universes branching off is the real green sun which powers every single game and universe. in order to make up for the power their session takes every space player must get ahold of their portion and devotw it to th center sun which continues to expand, eating very old universes in its path. natural cycle of life and death

  

if space player fails they don't have sufficient energy to have a successful session.

  
  

hugging/physical contact in general is ... complicated in troll world thendin here. it’s pretty much being so vulnerable that it has a kind of second meaning to it. hugging someone is usually only reserved for relationships, but isn’t exclusive to them. if two ppl r really good friends, like best fucking friends, they can hug, which is a sentiment that pretty much shows “i trust you with my life” and/or “i have a crush on you”.
