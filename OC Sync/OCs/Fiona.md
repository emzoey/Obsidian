fuck how do we organize this? whatever. started 1/2

## 1/2/26 

new idea: whenever someone is LOST, there is a "physical remnant" spot in unreality somewhere; essentially, where their physical body got "left behind". it's like unreality recognizes them as two separate beings now, so the body gets its OWN representation in unreality, just as an object would: a representation of all the perceptions, emotions, memories associated with that body. 
(wouldn't want to encourage the idea that their real body "dies" or whatever but bare with me here.)
fionas is ROTTING into the landscape, like a corpse melting and frozen during composition, think like its spreading a fungus that forms the environment around it. 


maybe theres only One fiona and youve been talking to figments of her?? that shes made of herself/? ?idk.

fiona is to unreality as aradia is to dream bubbles :D

when josie first appears in unreality, fiona really sells it as JOSIE'S little pocket world. fiona is just a guide. it is dubious whether she is even real; she may just be a figment of josie's imagination! an imaginary friend! 
fiona wants josie to believe this (just as fiona once believed herself; that this was her own little mind palace, until she learned it was not, and it blanketed everything we know). i think she wants josie here because she is lonely. she has not connected with the world, with other people, in so long. 
so it'd make sense that she panics a bit when she realizes that there's another guy here. 
maybe what fiona is slowly learning is that this truly never WAS her world. she has seen eli and kiv in the past, but brushed them off as figments, perhaps, denying them of the humanity that she now has to look in the face. 
fiona is having her only safe space breached.

she sees herself in josie and genuinely thinks that she is doing good for her.

i believe we owe it to fiona to make her a much more sympathetic character. make her more central to the story --- a role similar to kiv's, the prevalency of a deuteragonist. 
and i think she deserves a happy ending too. 

i think we need the narrative to recognize her as the sad character she is! just like we do kiv! just like we do kiv. 
it'd be interesting, in fact, if kiv is even MORE of an antagonist than fiona.

FUCKING. dirk inspo for FIONA???:
TT: Do you have any idea how fucking sick I am of myself?TT: I am completely worn out with my own identity. It's like I'm drowning in my own dismal persona.TT: I feel totally surrounded by it, inside and out. I can't escape from myself.TT: There seems to be no end to me. Like, wherever my mind falters, or threatens to retreat into the void in any way, my splinters pick up the slack, ensuring there'll always be more of myself than I could ever know what to fucking do with.TT: And you're always there to remind me of that, and throw it all in my face. God, I even built you to LITERALLY BE IN MY FACE, ALL THE TIME. It's like I subconsciously invented you just to troll myself, and never for a single fuckin' moment do you let me down.

UGHHHH then from the next page TT: I understand you are disgusted with me.TT: As an unpalatable expression of yourself.TT: I would feel the same way if I was in your situation.TT: Which I am.TT: As such, I know that you know this is wrong.TT: ...TT: Dirk.TT: Don't kill me.TT: Please.TT: I am scared.TT: You are?TT: Yes.TT: I am scared to not exist.TT: Aren't you?

## 1/4/26 1:02am though

so its kinda the same day

looks like we are departing fiona station going to DIRK CITY  i repeat DIRK CITY how have we never eralized this???? all these machinations and manipulations and desperation and chess-playing and endless explortations and splinters of dreadful self!

new age, kiv is more of an antagonist-antagonist while fiona is softening on that role a little, i think. so kinda flipping a bit. 

let's infuse her with dirk, aradia, and spoken for by flavor foley ,yes?
