fuck how do we organize this? whatever. started 1/2

## 1/2/26 

new idea: whenever someone is LOST, there is a "physical remnant" spot in unreality somewhere; essentially, where their physical body got "left behind". it's like unreality recognizes them as two separate beings now, so the body gets its OWN representation in unreality, just as an object would: a representation of all the perceptions, emotions, memories associated with that body. 
(wouldn't want to encourage the idea that their real body "dies" or whatever but bare with me here.)
fionas is ROTTING into the landscape, like a corpse melting and frozen during composition, think like its spreading a fungus that forms the environment around it. 


maybe theres only One fiona and youve been talking to figments of her?? that shes made of herself/? ?idk.

fiona is to unreality as aradia is to dream bubbles :D

---

when josie first appears in unreality, fiona really sells it as JOSIE'S little pocket world. fiona is just a guide. it is dubious whether she is even real; she may just be a figment of josie's imagination! an imaginary friend! 
fiona wants josie to believe this (just as fiona once believed herself; that this was her own little mind palace, until she learned it was not, and it blanketed everything we know). i think she wants josie here because she is lonely. she has not connected with the world, with other people, in so long. 
so it'd make sense that she panics a bit when she realizes that there's another guy here. 
maybe what fiona is slowly learning is that this truly never WAS her world. she has seen eli and kiv in the past, but brushed them off as figments, perhaps, denying them of the humanity that she now has to look in the face. 
fiona is having her only safe space breached.

she sees herself in josie and genuinely thinks that she is doing good for her.

i believe we owe it to fiona to make her a much more sympathetic character. make her more central to the story --- a role similar to kiv's, the prevalency of a deuteragonist. 
and i think she deserves a happy ending too. 

i think we need the narrative to recognize her as the sad character she is! just like we do kiv! just like we do kiv. 
it'd be interesting, in fact, if kiv is even MORE of an antagonist than fiona.

TT: It wasn't on purpose. Actually if I had a choice, I probably would have just said, fuck it. Sugar shock my brain, please.
TT: Suffice to say, I have trouble escaping from myself. It's kind of a problem. Let's not talk about it though. Please continue.
## 1/3/26

FUCKING. dirk inspo for FIONA???:
TT: Do you have any idea how fucking sick I am of myself?TT: I am completely worn out with my own identity. It's like I'm drowning in my own dismal persona.TT: I feel totally surrounded by it, inside and out. I can't escape from myself.TT: There seems to be no end to me. Like, wherever my mind falters, or threatens to retreat into the void in any way, my splinters pick up the slack, ensuring there'll always be more of myself than I could ever know what to fucking do with.TT: And you're always there to remind me of that, and throw it all in my face. God, I even built you to LITERALLY BE IN MY FACE, ALL THE TIME. It's like I subconsciously invented you just to troll myself, and never for a single fuckin' moment do you let me down.
(https://www.homestuck.com/007541)

UGHHHH then from the next page TT: I understand you are disgusted with me.TT: As an unpalatable expression of yourself.TT: I would feel the same way if I was in your situation.TT: Which I am.TT: As such, I know that you know this is wrong.TT: ...TT: Dirk.TT: Don't kill me.TT: Please.TT: I am scared.TT: You are?TT: Yes.TT: I am scared to not exist.TT: Aren't you?

## 1/4/26 1:02am though

so its kinda the same day

looks like we are departing fiona station going to DIRK CITY  i repeat DIRK CITY how have we never eralized this???? all these machinations and manipulations and desperation and chess-playing and endless explortations and splinters of dreadful self!

new age, kiv is more of an antagonist-antagonist while fiona is softening on that role a little, i think. so kinda flipping a bit. 

let's infuse her with dirk, aradia, and spoken for by flavor foley ,yes?

really LEAN INTO her being similar to josie in the past.

also i mean are you kidding me ? dirk strider literally kills himself all the time and chops his damn head off of COURSE hes fiona

FUCKKKKK im literally cheating off dirks paper rn. FUCK

TT: A realm that foretold of a life player who felt lifeless, a hope player who felt hopeless, and a heart player who was just a stone cold motherfucker.TT: When we talked about leadership, and I was all on my high horse telling you how shit would go down...TT: I also said I would be the one **"pulling the strings."** Remember? That I'd be the functional leader of our party.TT: And there might have been something to that, in a different session.TT: But what good is a "man of action" in a place where **action itself is intrinsically fruitless?**
	their session is inert, right, so no mechanisms of success. it is a STAGNANT session. we could argue that unreality is similarly stagnant, most of hte time (though the whole plot is that it ... isnt). regardless, it would be so so so interesting to have a moment like this from fiona; she thought that she'd be 'pulling the strings' but it is hard, if not impossible, to do so in a place that is intrinsically subjective/unchanging/immutable. 
	the land is hospitable and so is she. she thought she was controlling the land; **it was controlling her?**

i feel like fiona and josie's dynamic is shifting to something more like fiona admiring josie for her humanity, or something along those lines. **seeing her as the real "leader" who has made tangible change when NOTHING in fiona's life has changed as long as she can remember.**


TT: Tell her that I'm proud of her. TT: And as a person she's everything I wish I could be. TT: I wish I could be as nice and loving and selfless as her. TT: But can't.TT: Because I'm too busy being me.
	 REALLY REALLY REALLY interesting spin we could do for josie and fiona's dynamic maybe.  like, we used to say that she grows attached to josie. but in what way? and WHY???

1/7/26

taking another page from dirk's book, what about fiona being a genuinely bad person irl and KNOWING it and turning to unreality instead.

she doesn't think she can be saved, so she wants to save josie instead.

WAIT ERM THESE LYRICS FROM THE BECOMING BY NINE INCH NAILS? 

I beat my machine
It's a part of me, it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me, I am becoming

The me that you know, he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs, he is broken and sore
The me that you know, he doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore


The me that you know, he used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he is left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you, I'm so far away

I can try to get away, but I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all of my bad parts
I don't want to listen, but it's all too clear


Also this from "Everything" by NIN: 
[Verse 1]
I survived everything
I have tried everything
Everything, everything
And anything

[Chorus]
All the walls begin to dissolve away
Feel your hands begin to shake, to shake, to shake, to shake, to shake
And just who you think you used to be
All begins to bend and break, and break, and break, and break

[Verse 2]
Wave goodbye, wish me well
I've become something else
Something else, something else
(Just as well, really)

The errors are vast. And all consuming.
have fiona say this 

WAIT FUUCKK readijg back on all this...
if fiona has become one w unreality,  liek all her figments and splintees and shit r attached to it u know, open rkfts & reality's presence is  erasing her. shes like a spider being pulled into the bathtub drain, hoping praying begging she wont return to real-life. 

every time she spreads herself about, makes a new figment whatever,  she is dividing snd diluting herself, whatever that means

t also means that kiv can be fucken "*killing*" her if they can still break shit 


ooh what if fiona was hanging out in josies apt unreality on day 0/1 cuz she could feel some weord disturbance/upheaval from all the loaded obnects josie moved in w and checksd ot out?????? idk
