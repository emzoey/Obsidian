fuck how do we organize this? whatever. started 1/2

## 1/2/26 

new idea: whenever someone is LOST, there is a "physical remnant" spot in unreality somewhere; essentially, where their physical body got "left behind". it's like unreality recognizes them as two separate beings now, so the body gets its OWN representation in unreality, just as an object would: a representation of all the perceptions, emotions, memories associated with that body. 
(wouldn't want to encourage the idea that their real body "dies" or whatever but bare with me here.)
fionas is ROTTING into the landscape, like a corpse melting and frozen during composition, think like its spreading a fungus that forms the environment around it. 


maybe theres only One fiona and youve been talking to figments of her?? that shes made of herself/? ?idk.

fiona is to unreality as aradia is to dream bubbles :D

when josie first appears in unreality, fiona really sells it as JOSIE'S little pocket world. fiona is just a guide. it is dubious whether she is even real; she may just be a figment of josie's imagination! an imaginary friend! 
fiona wants josie to believe this (just as fiona once believed herself; that this was her own little mind palace, until she learned it was not, and it blanketed everything we know). i think she wants josie here because she is lonely. she has not connected with the world, with other people, in so long. 
so it'd make sense that she panics a bit when she realizes that there's another guy here. 
maybe what fiona is slowly learning is that this truly never WAS her world. she has seen eli and kiv in the past, but brushed them off as figments, perhaps, denying them of the humanity that she now has to look in the face. 
fiona is having her only safe space breached.

she sees herself in josie and genuinely thinks that she is doing good for her.

i believe we owe it to fiona to make her a much more sympathetic character. make her more central to the story --- a role similar to kiv's, the prevalency of a deuteragonist. 
and i think she deserves a happy ending too. 

i think we need the narrative to recognize her as the sad character she is! just like we do kiv! just like we do kiv. 
it'd be interesting, in fact, if kiv is even MORE of an antagonist than fiona.
