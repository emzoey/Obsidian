	ARANEA: 8ut this game was never meant to 8e played solo. ARANEA: Its format is inherently cooper8tive. The diversity of players, the com8in8tion of their efforts and aspects, this is what awakens the true cre8tive potential of the game. Without them, a session will wither and die. ARANEA: If one enters alone, it completely alters the nature of the game. It changes its purpose.
