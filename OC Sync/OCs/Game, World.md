take more inspriation from dream bubbles 

--- 

in A6I3 of homestuck, the games have a feature where you can only access certain areas/items by "being" another person. this is unlocked by little dream bubbles you stumble around. as meenah, you can't access them, since they aren't yours, so you have to become the right person in order to do that.
it would be interseting to incorporate something like that... you can't see this thing / get this item because you aren't the right person!

**TRANSCRIPTION**:
`But since this place is made of secrets, you've had to be extra careful with your secrets. You've carved out an extensive network of virtual catacombs throughout the bubbles, leading to hidden treasures, black recollections, and perhaps one or two illicit dropoff points.`

this could be for kiv or fifi maybe :D !!!!

more notes on how UNREALITY works again, with dream bubbles: 

VRISKA: When it comes to solving a 8ig mystery like this, it doesn't hurt that everywhere we go, places are composed of **the collective memories** of many different adventurers. 
VRISKA: We've explored ancient crypts, networks of 8urial mounds, dusty old tom8s, giant pyramids, you name it. **Hints** a8out the endgame are hidden all over the place.

VRISKA: There's nothing static out there. No landmarks, no points of reference. Nothing! 
VRISKA: If you want to make any headway in this gr8 8ig field of fuckall, SOMEONE has got to start wrecking some shit.

VRISKA: Every time he destroys another dream 8u88le, he does a little more damage to the furthest ring, inexplica8ly **shattering the essence of all-encompassing nothingness.** 
VRISKA: As the **cracks spread** across the void, new points of reference show up on our maps! VRISKA: Then we look at the angles and intersections and all the shapes formed 8y the cracks, and compare them to our notes from the various riddles and clues we've discovered a8out the path to the treasure. **THIS ABOUT RIFTS???? :D**

continued; something something LETTING rifts open / tearing them open... 
JOHN: that is pretty neat.
JOHN: so does that mean you know where the treasure is now? 
VRISKA: No, 8ecause the map isn't complete yet! 
VRISKA: Needs **more cracks** so we can plot the rest of the course. All we're a8le to do now is head in the right general direction. 
VRISKA: So ironically in order to **prevent reality** from 8eing destroyed, we need to w8 for it to 8e damaged further. In fact, we're 8etter off **encouraging it!**

at some point josie asks fiona wherher time passes here and fiona,  beijg so lost and far removed from physical reality, says no, bc igs easker for her to beliebe that. she also wants josie to see this place as a respite.  a future figment encoijter proves that wrong.

	"You buy all these things, fridges and TVs. and these things promise to make you happy. But at some point, they all start breaking down. They become ticking time bombs."

From a homestuck video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVN1u0L8qb8) 

This could be a really interesting way to approach designing rooms and such!! Like seriously, take notes from how Homestuck does it: the FIRST thing you see is a character's cluttered room, and a block of text listing every. single. thing. they own. and this REALLY solidifies their characterization; and is impossible in any other medium (at least as directly with say flavor text). 
	Think about what would be in everyones' rooms!! :)
