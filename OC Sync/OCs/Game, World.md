take more inspriation from dream bubbles 

--- 

in A6I3 of homestuck, the games have a feature where you can only access certain areas/items by "being" another person. this is unlocked by little dream bubbles you stumble around. as meenah, you can't access them, since they aren't yours, so you have to become the right person in order to do that.
it would be interseting to incorporate something like that... you can't see this thing / get this item because you aren't the right person!
