DESIGN VALUES:
- character
	- we NEED to care about these peoples' lives, backstories, and inner struggles since the game is about our PERCEPTION and our TRAUMA. 
	- putting people IN the characters' shoes
		- POV switching opportunities
		- choices
- strategy
	- resources?
	- risk and reward?
	- discussion puzzles?
- character + strategy = resolve
	- resource management (resolve)
	- risk v. reward (items, environments -> resolve)


everyone should have a pretty well solid outlined ROLE (maybe one that is their fatal flaw?). eg,
hunter is SELF-SACRIFICIAL: your tanky sacrifice mon, staller?, think like shed tail, memento, etc. 
eli is AVOIDANT: maybe he's the staller? distracter? stalls for time? 1
fiona is your COOPERATOR: support, boosts, helping hand, follow me, etc

1*what if figment battles are based on **TIME**: the amount of turns you have? think yttd monster battles.
- complements resource management, strategy
- complements genuine discussion puzzles; there's no time for guesswork
	- too punishing if you genuinely don't know?
- could raise the stakes -- eg, running out of time makes EVERYONE LOSE.
	- adds the element of also having to guess how many TURNS you'll have for a figment encounter based on its behavior/environment etc. eg, you can assume the fiestier ones have less turns to act with; and near the end you can get a solid answer. 
	- good failstate instead of having to juggle the "everyone gets to 0 rs" which takes too long
	- again, punishing
	- loss = progress loss?
		- CLASHES with how much this game is based on exploration and choices!!!! all things considered this is a LINEAR game with SET items and SET PUZZLES so losing progress should NOT be the punishment.
		- we want to care about CHARACTER. **what if we lose character, somehow?**
			- axing someone from the team is a no go; too hard to write for 
				- UNLESS, we care most about JOSIE'S rs. if she reaches 0, you lose
					- could lead to reckless/careless attitude toward other characters
					- maybe counts for the current POV character, not specifically josie
			- limiting their move pool?
				- kinda the same issue; figment fights would have to be possible w. most character combos
					- ...or not? could that kinda be the stakes there? if someone's at 0, then yeah you could still do puzzles n crap, BUT they are useless against figments. this could bar you from encounters that they are necessary in.
						- could create a nasty softlock/bottleneck where you're just standing waiting around for rs to refill becuase there's nothing else to explore / no other puzzles to do & you cant progress bc figment requires the character
			- having them sabotage others' efforts? their bad side comes out? 
				- still, that's not a *failstate*. 
			- what if we are looking in the wrong place? NO FIGMENT ENCOUNTERS?
				- EG, yttd's failstate is everybody dying. yes you lose progress but you also see them fail at their goal (escape and survive) and feel sad about it. you don't want your favorite char to die, yes, bc ull miss out on content, but honestly MAINLY because you do not want to see them treated unjustly. in a sense, **players protect the characters**. 
					- in that sense, we could tackle it more from the characters' ability to ESCAPE UNREALITY. if x amount of ppl reach 0 rs, then there's a special bad ending depending on day/char where you are essentially trapped in unreality forever (or its left open otherwise)
			- in terms of progress loss, what if the kinda CANONIZE losses in a sense; as in, losing might shift around your whole party's RS, throwing off whatever delicate balance you had before, incentivizing more interaction with the RS system (and thus world as a whole).
				- eg, everything feels weird, everyones kinda off today, so their resolve CHANGES from what it last was.
				- this would add more variety if restarting from last save/checkpoint whatever, bc you would get new options/routes/interactions anyway.
				- could be very frustrating though! imagine you get the perfect setup for a tough figment encounter puzzle then lose right after... and all your RS has been scrambled around, progress erased. i would put the game down for at least two weeks.
			- combining the two, a loss could be:
				- [x characters] have reached 0 RS (or otherwise encountered a specific, special loss event). On this day, at this time, this interaction happens, where you see that everyone has FAILED AT THEIR GOAL. After watching that happen and feeling bad about it, you LOSE PROGRESS, but there is some semblance of that last unreality journey: maybe some puzzles are streamlined already, and everyone has this vague, distorted sense of unease, which DISTORTS THEIR RS COUNT so it has a DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION. this means you will have different choices, interactions, skills, routes, etc. 
					- this could incentivize **losing on purpose** in order to get a more ideal RS spread. that isnt good for having compelling stakes/failstate
					- negates the careful tiptoeing balance of having to manage your RS. if it gets randomly scrambled after a loss, all your hard work there is practically erased. idk if that's a good idea or not; it would incentivize you to get back to the ideal point you were at last, and expose u to character moments u might not have seen before, but it could also feel frustrating and repetitive. it kinda throws out the stakes of RS since we are throwing RNG into the mix of what should be a strategy based mechanic. 
						- maybe it only affects the characters that reached 0 / "caused" the failstate? 

the idea of "no real failure" is fun but AMBITIOUS. Disco Elysium is UNATTAINABLY ambitious (statistically, at least). 
in other words lets not sign ourselves up for a disco elysium level project ok? 
for a game that has STRATEGY and RESOURCE on the line, there MUST be the threat of failure; otherwise, there is no reason to strategize at all. RISK DOES NOT EXIST (in a broad sense).
therefore, there SHOULD be failstates; running out of figment turns, or making a wrong choice at a specific time / during a specific event, or losing x amount of RS, and although you lose, you get ANOTHER TIDBIT OF CHARACTER and event UNIQUE TO YOUR RUN. 
- maybe certain losses at certain times grant RARE SKILLS/EVENTS; but seldom enough that it is not incentivized. more like little easter eggs than anything.
- these could be FUN!!!!!!!! we could explore EDGE CASES! what if one ending is similar to the yttd qtaro ending; a total betrayal that traps everyone inside?
	- this could be REALLY FUN FOR HUNTER........at 0 rs he becomes so paranoid and unstable and fearing for his life that he goes against EVERYTHING his character has espoused thus far.
	- this would change our writing approach. we would need to consider the intended scenario AND the worst-case scenario for every situation.  

the big issue here is that this CANONIZES, in some way, EVERY TIMELINE, every LOOP, and every FAILURE. yes, unreality is a weird distorted place where time and space don't work as they should, but i do NOT want to encourage the implication that it is working on TIMELOOP LOGIC, especially when this is a game about FIGURING OUT the MECHANICS OF UNREALITY, where there is no timeloop logic. i don't want to mess with timeline shit either, or characters "teleporting back"/"dying then reviving" either, for the same reason, but also cuz personal taste.
so we need to find a way to execute this that does NOT distract from the narrative; unreality is not a timeloop, we are not dealing with timelines, "deaths" are not canon; there is ONLY ONE CANON.
this is crucial to making unreality's logic a sound puzzle to solve!! letting this slip through the cracks could create huge false leads!!!!
- UNLESS we explore ways that this could COMPLEMENT how unreality operates.
	- this would have to be a quiet, consistent, invariable way. ex, soft-canonizing failstates might imply a timeloop situation which the player could only sniff out by noticing that failures are recognized in-game, which could inform choices later. this is NOT a timeloop game, right, so what IS it? how could we USE THIS?
	- unreality is largely based on perception (which encompasses memory and emotion). it is NOT a separate world from real life; it is the same, from a different angle. staying in there separates body from mind and erodes your realness. 
		- ..everyone becomes a little less real? or theres some sort of separation happening? some sort of DISSOCIATION during failstates? 
		- losing somehow breaks the divide between unreality and reality, which lead sto... uhh resetting shit? somehow? 
			- it breaks peoples' memories when u fail? (this would canonize EVERY FAILED RUN though.)
				- i mean... it could be a fun idea to play around with maybe? cuz like, since these ppl no longer remember the previous run, everything before their last checkpoint doesn't exist for them. maybe it's not that the CHARACTERS are being moved; it's that UNREALITY is reforming accordingly? (as in, imagine ppl are like Shiittt fuckkk im not real anymore. so i dont remember anything. and unrealitys like OK im unloading this area that would be impossible for you to exist in because you do not remember it. heres what u do remember. and it slides over to that place instead.)
				- could lead to some interesting moment near the end where ppl are like damn i did all that shit didnt i. 
					- idk thoguh this feels a bit distracted from my narrative intentions
		- well hm ok. loss = MENTAL BREAK. this is pretty literal. having 0 resolve means the character can no longer handle the situation and has reached their breaking point.
			- would a mental break somehow break unreality?
				- if this sends u back to last checkpoint, we would NEED to consider how this would play into Josies Big Day Out because its essentially NEGATIVE resolve; why wouldnt we just. reset? 
				- also wouldnt let kiv break unreality because it means that unrelaity would reset. 
			- well, okay, right, our implication here is that characters that are LOST essentially ahve already reached RS 0 at some point. they lost all hope and all connection to the world.
				- this could tie in to mental break = unreality break bc kiv is able to destroy unreality, and fiona is able to manipulate it.
				- maybe... all the failstates, no matter what, are bad, right? what if THAT pushes josie's RS to 0? and what if, for whatever reason, JOSIE'S lost-state "power" causes that reset to happen? 
					- (doesn't she not want to escape at some point tho? she kinda likes unreality. like. idk if she would break if she found out there wasnt a way out.)
					- this could imply a mini big-day-out happens where shit goes crazy style which is funny 
						- hm. HM. well. JOSIE ends up back at the VERY START OF THE GAME during the VERY ENDING SECTION. the setup for this might already be here. (revisiting the house, but things are different). we dont have a super solid explanation for this yet; could this be it? 
							- ("reliving the past" fits hunter, not josie; "revising the past" fits eli more than josie. i feel like this isn't a super character-specific/appropriate power yet.)
							- well ok umm her whole thing is illusions right. and emotional storms essentially. Projecting Her Emotoins. umm. she doesnt like failling????? but ughhh that dodsnet work... i really really dont like the idea that each run doesnt have the same people from last time, eg a davesprite situation, having alpha/beta vers of charas, whatever. theyre ALL THE SAME GUY.
							- josie does not have time powers. she does not hate failure  SO MUCH that she would reset time to do it over again. like thats kinda fucking broken bc shes resetting it for EVERYONEEEE not just her. 
								- ok she kinda hates failure that much but her attitude is more suck it up, walk it off!!!!! make sure it doesn't happen again! rewinding siffrin style wouldnt make as much sense for her character. she just adds failures to her internal failure pile and is like yep im a failure for sure lets not address this ever and just keep on walking. 

i think this is where i'm getting caught: resetting time/progress for ALL CHARACTERS is a breach of my scope. unreality is literally REWINDING TIME!!! FOR EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE!! which changes it from this small pocket of unreality to the ENTIRE FABRIC OF SPACETIME. which unreality doesnt have say over. 

ok wait. dream bubble inspo?
