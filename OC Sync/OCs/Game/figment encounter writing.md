Josie starts feeling nostalgic, which disturbs her, and provokes even more disturbing memories to arise from the earth. 

Maybe the figments are spouting some nonsense that somehow contradicts the memory. They are regurgitating it as how it happened, not how Josie experienced it; but to us, their recountings are the false ones. Maybe their world salad would cue her and only her into their disconnect from the memories popping up?

Would be interesting to have the answer lie in the figment’s LAST action rather than its current behavior.




The memory ends. You feel queasy, back on Earth, regaining some semblance of your surroundings...

"Shit!"
Eli jumps, you whip your head around, just to see something rustling deeper in the trees.
It slithers like a shadow, like it's being affected by heat waves. It sneaks between far away tree trunks.
"Dude, are you good?!"
When he looks at you, he looks scared, or at least rattled.
You swallow a terrible lump in your throat...
Eli presses his hand against his forehead, reeling around to look back into the trees. Under his breath: "man, am I just seeing shit?"
You can't bring yourself to address his question. Your breath comes out frustratingly shaky. "I saw it too."
"Saw what?" His words are clear as ever. He looks at you intensely.
"Um... there was something in there..." You gesture in a small way towards the deeper forest...
Eli licks his lips. Looks to you. Looks away again. "Maybe we should, uh..."
You don't want him leading this venture. Not after yesterday.
			"Maybe... go the other direction?" qyou suggest. You'd love to phrase that one as sardonically as you thought it.


THEY'RE BEING STALKED. Or, so they think.
The figment walks the same path Josie always used to when she was younger. 
She sees strange 'footprints' in the ground in front of her a lot of the time.



Distract it so you can slip by unnoticed or convince it that the memory is wrong, making it leave / that its in the wrong place.

You have to confuse it, muddle the past, and thus make it lose ‘interest’. 

You have to recount it with the “wrong” thing that happened in the memory (essentially a memory test—we are taking Josies interpretation as fact) 

When it speaks, it recounts what happened in the memories or echoes vague sentiments (the emotions H&J respectively felt when they were there; these sentiments may very well contradict each other then.) → When it speaks, it contrasts itself

The figment looks like it has a mouth → try to speak to it

Ghosts that need closure? → Try and recount what happened to it? 

The figments are causing the memories → we need to get them out

Could try to scare it off, but that hasn’t worked often at all. Try to distract it? → It seems occupied by something, seeing someone that isnt there (old josie). 

Memories are coming from the figment → Could it want to swallow us up in the memories? 

Every time we see a memory, we see a figment. → You can’t argue with that.
