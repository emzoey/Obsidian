This is not about escapism. It is about learning how to live after trauma.

**UNREALITY**

	Everyone is introduced to unreality in their own distinct, yet congruent ways; reality 'bursts a leak', generating a warp that gives way to what seems an entirely separate dimension. These leaks are called RIFTS. The longer the leak persists, the harder it is to tell what is real in this world and what is not.

	Unreality 'covers' reality in the way a colored lens may cover an image. It is essentially the same environments as what exists in reality, but seen from ANOTHER ANGLE. The attitudes and emotions we attribute to certain locations/objects are manifested in unreality. In a word, it could be otherwise called PERCEPTION. It is our perception, which we layer over the world around us to make sense of it.
	As such, unreality is built on EMOTION and MEMORY.
	For example, a place where one was isolated in REALITY may have an UNREALITY counterpart that is confusing to traverse, be themed with a loss of signal, and be clouded with an obscuring fog. A place in REALITY that someone has many powerful memories attached to, may appear in UNREALITY as a landscape that reflects perfectly what that person remembers... interspersed with other things, things that aren't theirs. Unreality is NOT constructed purely by one person's associations. It is an AMALGAMATION of ALL associations, memories, emotions.

	Unreality is largely a stark black-and-white landscape with meandering, curved features. It's sparse and unremarkable. Its shapes meld into each other. Certain areas, however, begin to sleepily regain their color, gradually, the farther you travel in. 

	The aimless, black and white part of the landscape are unreality's OUTSKIRTS. As memories decay, their elements have nowhere else to go. The outskirts are uncanny and lonely, only inhabited by fragments of old landscapes/memories. *(Can easily be compared to the Blank Space in Omori, or the rooms of Yume Nikki.)*

	The colored parts of unreality are, for our purposes, the 'Meat and Potatoes' of unreality. It's attached to places where the most emotion resides. Unofficially called REALMS, each person effectively has their own. Most often, it is tethered to somewhere that a person spent a lot of time. For instance, a childhood house.  The landscapes here are dedicated to reflecting a person's experiences and mindset. Compared to the OUTSKIRTS, these REALMS are more cohesive and coherent in their theming. *(Can easily be compared to Deltarune's different dark worlds, especially Chapter 4's dark world.)*

	What with unreality being a reflection of someone's perception, it can change accordingly. This process takes time, however. If you feel that unreality is unsafe, it will slowly reflect that back to you, appearing as a scarier place. 

	With RIFTS present in reality, the influence of unreality begins to spread. Think of it like an ever-widening radius that expands from the RIFT at its center. In this radius, this circle of influence, unreality can bend the rules of reality. Reality starts displaying more unreality-like traits; it reflects emotion, perception, memory.
	When a living person enters unreality, they can ONLY EXPLORE WITHIN THE RADIUS OF INFLUENCE. This is because they still EXIST in reality and are thus tethered to it. 
	Because unreality's landscapes reflect reality's, that same radius thereby exists in UNREALITY'S LAND. As such, this means that a living person inside unreality can only explore as far as unreality has influenced reality.
	If all things are in order and unreality hasn't leaked too far, one can enter and exit unreality through rifts as they please. Rifts do not move (they are anchored in one place).
	
	Entering unreality is a point of NO RETURN. You can only explore places in reality that have been AFFECTED BY UNREALITY'S INFLUENCE. Put simply: you are now stuck in the rift's radius. (You can't have your, uh, unreality, and eat it too?) Venturing beyond this radius takes you to a vast WHITENESS. Eventually, the space loops back on itself, and you find yourself on the opposite side of the circle. It's like you walked around the globe. Pick one direction, keep walking, you end up back where you started.

	As such, after entering unreality, there are limited places to explore. However, MORE THAN ONE rift can exist at once, and, the more time that rift exists, the LARGER the influence of unreality becomes. Over time, you get more places to explore.

	Be careful, though; too long, and there will be no more distinction between unreality and reality. There will be no more distinction between real and unreal.

	Unreality has always existed. It always will. Try not to let it CONSUME YOUR REALITY.


**FIGMENTS**

	Figments are the mobile limbs of unreality. In less pretentious words, they are CREATURES THAT ROAM UNREALITY. Most have little in common with each other except that they are PURE BLACK AND PURE WHITE. They are made from unreality. They are not necessarily 'separate'.

	As such, even if they can move, even when they speak, they do NOT have minds of their own. They are like an ever-repeated memory, operating purely on the emotions and memories they are made of. You may think of them as MEMORY SYSTEMS that behave only based on what they know -- and even then, do they know anything? 

	They are a natural part of unreality's landscapes. They're just another function of how unreality reflects perception. 

	Most have distinct behavior and abilities. By abilities, I do NOT mean powers. I mean the ability to move, speak, see, smell, touch. No figment can do all 5; they are not alive. Some are roamers that, like a zoo animal, walk the same path every day until they decay; some stay in one place; some insist that they are awake and knowing and can talk with you, but are not. Some appear aggressive. Some appear benign. It is NIGH-IMPOSSIBLE to tell from a glance. However, features of their DESIGN and BEHAVIOR may clue you in on how to approach and deal with one... and even how to deal with the environment they exist in.

	With enough of unreality's influence leaking into reality, they may just begin appearing in your town.
	

**MISMEMORIES**

	What with unreality operating on perception, its reflections of the real world are going to have some contradictions. MISMEMORIES are the same object with different appearances between reality and unreality.
	For example, a person may MISREMEMBER that they have a book referencing unreality. In unreality, they read the book, and it's exactly as they remember. If this same book is found in real life, however, it is not at all related (it's a book on Birds of Pennsylvania 1995...). This is because unreality is reflecting the REMEMBERED VERSION OF THE OBJECT. Thus, unreality is not a one-to-one match to reality and can, in some instances, even be deceptive. What you find in unreality may not exist in reality in the same way at all. 
	

**'LOST'**: Losing yourself

	What happens if someone spends too much time away from reality?
	Slowly, over time, they become less real. But, they did not die; they still exist in the real world; they still live in the real world, go about their daily activities... how?
	They have become LOST. Simply put, to become lost is to have your mind separated from your body. They may be going through the motions in reality, but their mind is ELSEWHERE. In that way, they can be in two places at once; reality and unreality simultaneously. People who are NOT LOST can only be in ONE OR THE OTHER. 
	Those that have been lost to unreality are NOT bound to unreality's influence on reality. They can go wherever they want in unreality. And, with them existing as a kind of mental self, they can manipulate unreality. They can manipulate themselves. One's lost mental self looks and operates differently than their physical self, even though they are the same person. 
	These two 'halves' will never meet as they are not truly independent. If a lost person exits unreality, they will simply return to being ONE in their physical body in reality. If a lost person's reality-half goes into unreality, they will be ONE with their mental-half in a similar manner. (They can exist in two places at once, but not one place at twice?) 
	Being lost is a mind-body split. It is resigning from reality.
	They have fallen out of time. The world will continue spinning without them. They will not live a real life.


GAMEPLAY

	The gameplay operates largely on discussion puzzles, environmental puzzles, and POV-switching.
	Discussion puzzles: Used to get past an insurmountable obstacle, like an unpredictable figment or larger-than-life mystery. For instance; (1) a figment has been stalking you. You and the cast may put your heads together to figure out how it behaves, and thus how to avoid it or make it go away. (2) A character claims to have been at place X during Y time. However, they were found in place Z. Figure out that this movement is only possible with the way unreality loops back on itself. *(Compare to Your Turn To Die main games and Disco Elysium dialogue trees.)* Characters will lie. Characters will make mistakes. You may or may not catch it.
	Environmental puzzles: Often go hand-in-hand with discussion puzzles. If discussion puzzles arrive at a LOGIC ANSWER, these arrive at an ACTION ANSWER. Used to get past a smaller, environmental obstacle. For instance; a mechanical wall that stretches on infinitely in each direction. Point-and-click, sequential puzzle that requires certain objects and actions to shut down the mechanism and let you through.
	POV switching: Allows you to be in two places at once. You can switch POVs between different characters depending on the current part of the story. Not everyone will be available all the time. This provides you with a different character's internal monologue, skills, and dialogue choices. This also allows you to solve trans-reality puzzles, where one character is in unreality, and another is in reality... you can just swap between both!

**IMPRESSIONS TAB**

	Bookkeeping system. Compiles profiles of each character using all the information you have collected on them throughout your runs. With each run having different interactions, each impression tab will look different!
	Used in discussion puzzles at times for evidence. You can use it to recall certain things a character has said or done.
	Stores 'quest markers', eg, "Character told me they would be at Place in the afternoon today."
	*Compare to Of The Devil's profiles and evidence tabs.*

**RESOLVE (RS)**

	A situation as uncanny as unreality is bound to take a toll. Characters' dialogue and skill options are affected by their RESOLVE, a number range from 1 to 10. This is not a sanity meter; instead, it measures how well they are able to cope with the circumstances.
	Whether or not this coping is good or bad depends on each character. Having a HIGHER resolve does not mean having BETTER options. Different levels of resolve are not inherently BAD; they are just DIFFERENT. 
	For instance, a character may only have the ability to pick locks at resolve level 8+ (8 and above). At resolve level 3 (and only 3), they instead kick down doors. 
	Since this influences a character's behavior, this also influences how DISCUSSION PUZZLES operate. At different RS, a character may be more belligerent and secretive, or more high-strung and paranoid, or more closed-off and hard to read. 
	Resolve is CHANGED by different characters being in certain situations. For instance, one character may have their resolve PASSIVELY LOWERED by being in a landscape that has fire and smoke. Being in this place makes their resolve lower the longer they are in it. Another character may have their resolve INSTANTLY LOWERED by 'losing' a figment encounter and feeling cornered. This event caused their resolve to drop by, say, 2 levels.
	On the flip side, a character may have their resolve PASSIVELY INCREASED by being in reality. Unreality freaks them out, so the longer they're in reality, the higher their resolve and ability to cope becomes. Another character may have their resolve INSTANTLY INCREASED by being given a weapon. It makes them feel safer and more capable of taking on their fear of unreality.

**DAY SYSTEM**

	This story takes place within 5 days. Each day, more and more of unreality leaks out. Each day, you learn more about unreality, and how to seal that leak.
	Each day has three sections: afternoon, evening, and night. Characters will be in different places during each section. Time advances after certain events have been flagged, eg you solve a certain puzzle. As such, you cannot get to every interaction in a single playthrough.



**CHARACTER BASICS**

*Josie Tucholski*
	The protagonist. Your ONLY POV for discussion puzzles. People-pleasing, polite pushover with a scathing, cynical inner monologue and general distrust for others, she was promised safety in the current institutions and systems of America. Is trying and failing to pull herself up by the bootstraps. Keeps herself afloat and creates an illusion of stability through her black-and-white worldview based on self-imposed truths (good things are not easy things, what is best for others may not be best for me, nobody gives without expecting something in return, what you get is what you earn...). Young and alone and naive. Too hard on herself. Was once a bright, if not still cynical, and ambitious kid interested in creating things. After losing everything in a fire, she's trying to shed any semblance of sentimentality she may have left.
FUN FAXX:
- For what little she allows herself to like, she cannot escape her quirky millenial love for twee.

*Hunter Valdez*
	Josie's childhood best friend who she'd rather forget. Bleeding-heart emotional, existential, honest hypocrite with hard-set opinions on what's best.  In spite of his family's wealth, he never quite felt anything was purely his own, having grown up with grandparents mourning a woman he never met: his dead mother. Pretending to mourn her felt morally wrong. Sitting and mulling over those thoughts led him to prioritize authenticity above all. As such, he's become vehemently passionate about his interests (namely music, urban legends, general old internet mysteries) and protective of those he cares about. He's emotionally intelligent and tactful, but not without glaring blind spots about what's best for others. Now, his life has stagnated, sitting comfortably without many real ambitions, instead always waiting for the past to greet him again with open arms. 
FUN FAXX:
- Holden Caufield from Catcher in the Rye was instrumental to his character.
- Has a general New England/Pennsylvania accent, much like Josie. However, he rolls his R's on words like 'through' or 'three'. its such a specific vocal thing that so many people ive known do

*Eli Cheng*
	College grad who has yet to decide what he really wants with his life. He's an intense, colorful, enthusiastic person with a loud and reckless disposition (and an undeniable tone-deaf streak). Having taken after his sleazy older brother and raised in a household with inconsistent consequences, he's always padded after other people to decide for him what's right and wrong. Despite a big personality, he has little genuine interests or ambitions, and he knows it, and he wants to escape that void so desperately.  He's hurt a lot of people in his life. In his book, he's an inherently destructive person. After falling in with a bad group in high school, he stood uncomfortably by as they burned down a house. He didn't do anything to stop it. Ever since, he has been stuck as an insomniac, struggling from repeated lucid nightmares. He places all the blame on himself, but it was a tug-of-war: lose his social safety and prevent a disaster, or stop something that might not even happen, and lose his place? His lofty, larger-than-life reactions and faux-stupidity are just another way to evade truly confronting what he's done, and recognizing his distinct lack of self.
FUN FAXX:
- Having been born with anophthalmia, he only has his left eye. The right eye is a prosthetic. Around the age of 18, he got a blue replacement, effectively giving himself fake heterochromia. He's due for another replacement soon, luckily. (He lowkey thinks it looks stupid too, but isn't gonna think too hard about it.)
	- He has terrible vision in his left eye. The only reason you don't see him wearing thick-ass glasses everywhere is because of his contact lens.
	- Not insecure about this -- he will tell you outright if you ask -- but it influenced his want to be accepted/to fit in as a kid.
- Dealing with a situationship pre-plot bc he can't get his interpersonal ducks in a row. (Neither can she, I imagine.) How can you expect this guy to be intimate with people he genuinely cares about when he can't even get to know himself?
- One or two grade levels higher than Hunter and Josie. 2nd oldest in the cast.
- Drives a 2013 Toyota Corolla. Likes to drive. Actually a good driver.

*Alex "Kiv" Shelby*
	They don't show up for the first 3 days, but their presence is pervasive in little unexplainable mysteries around unreality. They're a strange sort of antagonist and strange person all around, it seems. Some people are just born with a restlessness. An adventurous, capricious person, always having sought stability, now isolated in an abusive situation where their one predictable comfort is in games and media. They have given up on being seen as anything but a ghost or a disagreeable boy. They rarely leave their room. When forced out by unreality, Kiv is enigmatic, frustrating, cold, and can bitingly mean if pushed... they're easily mistaken as someone with their head in the clouds, but they're sharply aware. Integral to peoples' consistent misunderstandings of them is their inability to feel, process, or name their emotions. Kiv is stuck in a perpetual state of numbness. Even then, all they want is to return to the misery they know, even if it means breaking unreality in the process. They have been lost for a long time; they are their physical half. (Note: Alex is not their deadname. Kiv as a nickname is not related to gender; it's a way of separating themself from their abusive home life.)
FUN FAXX:
- If you could travel back in time and ask them what they want to be when they grow up, they'd say a park ranger.
- Makes YTPs. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DqGgIgx4KU (I cannot express just *how much* this is something they'd make.)
- Has Raynaud's Syndrome.
- Used to enjoy playing instruments.
- Grew up on 1990s/early 2000s rap.
- Their favorite season is summer. Low cold tolerance.
- For as much as they've been through, their depression is largely just genetic.
- Their voice always sounds a little congested. They're just like that.

*Fiona*
	Fiona is Josie's guiding light through unreality. She's poised, good at knowing when to let people try things out on their own, surprisingly open, a good confidant... at first. Sometimes, she slips. Says some strange things. She has been lost to unreality for a long time; we know only her mental half. Having forgotten large blocks of her life, she'd rather escape than question why she's turned out to be such a disappointment, or ponder what terrible things have led her to be the way she is. She has become fascinated by unreality's reflection of memory and emotion. In some ways, she hopes it may let her remember herself; in other ways, it's a means for her to reconstruct herself. So, when unreality leaks, and reality starts hurtling towards her again, what more is she to do than seal all exits to reality? Selling the idea that she's helping everyone seal off unreality, she purposefully withholds truths about the nature of this strange 'other world' in order to close off all leaks to reality so she can remain, undisturbed, in her own realm. 
FUN FAXX:
- Definitely not cis. Don't know how. Any non-cis gender you want is canon for her. 
- Tallest of the group, and the oldest by quite a couple years.

	October 31, 2014 -- DAY 5, End. Josie breaks. She sees no point in returning to real life; why not just let it all collapse in on itself? What is the point if nothing she believes in is true? When she realizes she no longer has any allies, however, it all collapses... all the emotions that have been exploding outward, implode back inside her.
	In the end, unreality is not sealed away. Instead, unreality and reality separate again, and we are left with the knowledge that we may still see things that should not be there, movement in the corner of our eye, but we will live with it. They will all continue living. The world will not leave them behind.
