# how they could cry / how easily

hunter: easy. at movies. we know this.

josie: easy, too, easier than she and you would think. she hates it and tahts what makes her actually cry, i think, the loathing that she is about to cry at all. the kind of thing where she would get slighted or told that she should have put more effort in (she puts 100% in all the time) and would run to the bathroom and try to stop herself from crying. shes more sensitive than youd think

Fiona: easier than youd think but not as easy as h/j. she compartmentalizes things to think about later (eg, knowing she did something bad to someone that didn't deserve it/her own conscience, being anxious about her plans not working out) and ends up crying about them when she thinks ab them in private. like when shes going to sleep type of thing. if she were to cry in front of people, it would be a cry of desperation. a messy pull your hair out cry

kiv: in the form theyre in now, i think crying is rare. we know this. if they were to cry, itd be after a near miss; being sat shellshocked and raw after just so nearly failing or dying or getting injured and just sitting with it. thats when they can cry. like if they were about to get attacked by a bear and it was about to strike, but was suddenly vaporized, and theyre just sitting there.
and this one is less likely, but the other circumstance may be the rare instance where they get too far into their self-loathing; they would cry, vitriolic, at themselves, how much they hate themselves and their life, knowing that they're so fucked and hopeless and they wish they weren't trans. cry o hate.

eli void and fiona light or flip flopped?? :D

FIRST THOUGHTS:
fiona: heart or light or void or space
- **knight of void**: exploits nothingness/mystery/unawareness for their own use, manipulates ppl. 
	- All that which is unknown, or hidden, obscure or even nonexistent is at their disposal.
	- They can exploit a person’s secrets to either be used against them or exploit how people can sometimes disregard certain things or view them as unimportant. They might worry about whether or not something is truly meaningless or irrelevant. Sometimes they might even wonder if they themselves are truly irrelevant or unimportant in the grand scheme of things.
	- A Knight of Void will struggle finding out what exactly it is they are good at, but once they know what that thing is, nothing can stop them.
	- They would like pull strings from the background and exploit what other people either can’t comprehend or just simply ignore.
- **sylph of heart:**
	- too moral for her but worth a look
- **knight of light**: fears personal lack of knowledge/luck/light?
- **mage of void**: completely understands/is drowning in secrets, obscurity, nothing
- HEART ASPECT OMG: Those bound to the aspect of Heart are very concerned with their favorite subject: themselves. It wouldn't be a stretch to call them 'self-obsessed', but not necessarily in a negative way. They simply want to understand the one thing we all are stuck with for our entire lives, i.e. our own minds. Forging an identity is extremely important to the Heart-bound, and every decision and action goes toward building a coherent narrative of their own story. That isn't to say Heart-bound don't care deeply for their friends and allies; they just have a tendency to assume that everyone is as concerned with identity as they are. They are excellent at putting on and taking off masks as the situation calls for them. At their best, they are competent, imaginative, and steady. At their worst they can be overbearing, inflexible, and cold.
- **maid of heart**? a lack of self/passion in their life (memory) so they create their own (figments + manipulation) 
- ok so fiona LACKS in Heart (seeing her own self, seeing other peoples') and is desperately trying to overcompensate for it -- manipulating others, ceaselessly investigating herself. she "creates" heart by splintering herself like dirk?? 
- knight of heart; exploits others' selves to protect unreality, which is connected to heart. is insufficient in heart.
- 
eli: void or light or heart. fuck
- **page of heart**
	- Pages of Heart start out with a deficit in Heart and try to overcompensate for it in their attempts to overcome it. So they try to act irrational and impulsive and going by their instincts, but they would either be way off on their instincts of they would follow the wrong impulses, or interpret them wrong.
	- BUT a lot about trying to be compassionate, being too honest, etc
- prince of light // blinded by aspeect and destroys it. doesnt investigate his toxic tendencies n continues to destroy good things. wants to be dumb and irrelevant. withholding so much info.  knows how shit works n tells no one. refuses to learn from his actions
- prince of mind??
hunter: time or blood or life
- mage of time: knows deeply from experience and can suffer from time; death, endings,  movement, time passing. pretty cut and dry no?
kiv: breath or blood or mind
- **bard of blood:** passive destruction of connections/cooperation/stability
	- we already know this, but interesting add'n: Their challenge though is not to be ruled by the whims of their Aspect, but rather to come out of it with a healthy respect and understanding of it. A Bard of Blood that has risen to and came through their challenge will not take their bonds and loyalty, those connected to them, for granted ever again.
josie: rage or doom or life or hope
- **bard of life**: 
	- Their challenge is to not be controlled by the whims of their aspect though and so they must eventually give up or run out of their craved thing and come to accept its absence once again. Maybe they come to terms with death, or sink back into submissive acceptance.
	- They invite the destruction of any kind of luxury, temptation or optimism with their own overwhelming cautious pessimism and repulsion of ever breaking the rules and limits which guide them. They forgo and ignore any other options they have out of fear of reckless unrestriction. A Bard of Life’s crisis would be something like suddenly becoming overwhelmed with reckless temptation for something. They want and crave something so much that they break rules, sacrifice their friends and family, recklessly reaching for what they want
	- They would have very submissive and cautious attitudes, even more so than usual for a Bard, and be extremely non-confrontational. They won’t argue with someone who tells them to do something, they would see it as necessary and quietly accept it. They live their lives fulfilling responsibilities and obligations and very strictly following the rules. They are very quiet and submissive, believing anything different than what they already do to be futile and not worth it. They either feel extremely limited or they place themselves under rules and limits to feel comfortable and safe.
- rogue of rage?? 



MY UNDERSTANDING 
Light: knowledge, luck, ambition, loopholes
Void: obscurity, lacking, secrets, depth
Heart: identity, desires, soul
Blood: stability, connections, leadership, stubborn, trust
Time: preservation, death, entropy, action/stagnation, repetition/patterns,  multipilicity
Space: creation/propagation, patience, unity
Rage: truth, nuance, injustice, transition
Hope: ideals, faith, manifestation, influence
Doom: limits, endings, inevitability
Life: indignation, survival, power, change
Breath: freedom, unbound, independence 
Mind: causality, potential, observant, impersonal, rationality

knight - wields/exploits aspect despite perceived insufficiency
page - starts off as misguidedly confident when actually insufficient; grows to truly embody aspect
bard - passively destroys/destroys through 
prince - tormented by and destroyer of aspect
maid - grows into and maintains 
sylph - inserts aspect where lacking


fiona lacks identity and attempts to make up for that lack via picking herself and others apart -- something heart or mind

eli lacks identity and avoids that truth by being socially infallible, acting dumb/oblivious, and refusing to change -- erm idk man void.? rage? 
prince of light: is tormented by knowledge, luck, and ambition; destroys knowledge, luck, and ambition 
someone who knows  lotta things they dont want to and escape unscatched, reach for ambitions that are destroying them, purposefully obsfucate/skew others' luck, access to knowledge
is tormented by their relevance and seeks to destroy it / is destroyed by their relevance, knowledge,  luck, ambition; & destroys it in others 


**Class** describes the **character's arc and emotional hurdles**, while **Aspect** describes the **character's base personality traits by which this arc is experienced.**

3. For example, all three Seers struggle with hubris: Rose's need to be the smartest person in the room led to her being manipulated by Doc Scratch, Terezi's obsession with meting justice led to her engineering a situation where the only option was to kill Vriska, and Kankri's desire to be seen as a spiritual leader amongst his friends led to him furthering their divisions and harming them.

What's interesting is, if you start analyzing characters that share Classes and Aspects, these specific types of similarity crop up over and over - all our Knights struggle with insecurities and facades, both our Bards have a crisis of faith. All three Breath players have an aspect of immaturity and childishness to their characters, and all three Light players are deeply concerned with appearing intelligent and feeling important.

Aspect represents the fundamental way a character _is,_ and thus, color every interaction that character has. There's a reason Ultimate Selfhood is sought through Aspect, not Class - Aspect is the core of the character's being, what makes that person that person.

Finally, something interesting to note is that nearly every Aspect follows its own Hero's Journey cycle - full actualization for each one usually means reaching around to its opposite Aspect, and taking lessons from them - for example, Breath players need to learn maturity and responsibility, while Blood players need to learn relaxation and whimsy. Thus, an Aspect at its worst manifests in two ways - either a toxic overabundance of the Aspect's worst traits, or such a dearth of the aspect that it begins to resemble its opposite. Only by reaching into the opposite, however, can the player be tempered and reach full maturity - can they become more of who they are.



Light players, naturally, are erudite and educated, possessing keen intellects and cunning minds. They are fond of knowledge itself, of markers of status and prestige - whether that's wealth, the adulation of the masses, or a massive library. They harbor a desire to be important, to be seen, to be acknowledged, and are happiest when they are looked up to. Conversely, they deal poorly with being looked down upon. Their confidence transmutes easily into hubris, and they struggle with having that pride challenged. As such, they tend to be volatile and unpredictable, quick to retaliate against those who threaten their egos, or obsequious to those whose acknowledgement they desire.

Their desire for the limelight can quickly spell disaster - they can become incredibly cruel, harsh, and egotistical in their pursuit of narrative significance. They forget, in their obsession, that they, too, are fallible and flawed, and the inevitable reminder can come very harshly. Light players struggle with moderation, and as such, when they feel shame, they'll often take drastic measures to cope with it - deliberately darkening their own influence or intellects, removing themselves from the "story" entirely - something which superficially resembles Void's penchant for the background, but which is firmly rooted in Light's obsessive need for drama.


hus are Void players ever cosigned to the background, though this generally suits them fine. Void players are very self-possessed. Where Light players tend to exaggerate and complicate, Void players are honest and simple, preferring straightforward solutions. They don't tend to think very hard, instead letting intuition and emotion guide them to where they want to be - which makes them one of the more stable personalities on a team. However, this simplistic, feelings-driven approach often leads to pleasure-seeking behavior, poor impulse control, and overindulgence in vice, and from there, to irrelevance, with which Void is so closely interlinked.

Void players are especially prone to vice, and at their worst, will become so drunk on pleasurable activities that they pursue them to the active detriment of the party's goals or the Void player's self-improvement - making them the ultimate irrelevant character.

Heart, then, is associated with feelings, motivations, intuition, the soul, and the self. To a Heart player, they "are" because they "feel" like they are - and they're keenly aware of the multitudes that are contained within themselves. Deeply concerned with the "cause" of cause-and-effect, they're drawn to desires, those of themselves and of others, especially where strong feelings are concerned. Heart players are gifted with an intuitive understanding of those around them, both their good and bad qualities, and are tasked with the grand task of bringing out the best.

It stands to reason, then, that Heart players have a firm grasp on who they are and what they want. For the same reasons, it's difficult for a Heart player to truly hate or condemn another person, because they are so adept at understanding them. However, this understanding comes with a price - because the Heart player is so aware of themselves, they can't escape their own worst traits - nobody self-loathes as accurately as a Heart player can.
Given this clarity, the Heart player becomes the team's emotional core, able to raise up each teammate's best qualities, while helping them deal with their worst, enabling everyone to be the best possible version of themselves - which the Heart player knew them to be all along.

Rage, then, is the power of denial. If Hope reduces the "fakness" of a thing, then Rage reduces its "realness". Rage, too, is a means of defining reality, in this case taking a torch to the aspects of reality that it rejects. In more passive Classes, this works in subtler ways, stoking others towards destructive fury. Rage is associated with anarchy, chaos, revolution, destruction, anger, and nihilism. A Rage player will not suffer a world that does not satisfy them, breaking it to pieces, such that something new can take its place.
However, unlike Hope players, who can't help but be pathetically sincere, Rage players are incredibly self-conscious, and often try to mask and hide their embitterment and anger. This, ironically, leads to further ostracization, as others can tell they're being inauthentic. This only further compounds their sense of alienation, and drives them further into smoldering resentment


This means that when a character's Classpect inverts their Aspect, it doesn't mean that they suddenly become a hero of the opposing Aspect - rather, it means that, at their very worst - at the nadirs of their character arcs - they will lean so much into their Aspect's worst traits that it will superficially appear as the opposite, when all it really is is an absence of themselves.

Time's worst traits superficially resemble Space, Light's resemble Void, and vice versa - Grimbark Jade is the Condesce's taskmaster, and Porrim at her worst was as much of a nag as Kankri, trying to do a Time player's managerial job. Horuss and Equius at their worst won't shut up and won't stop talking over their partners. So on and so forth.

an Active Class performs their Aspect, and a Passive Class allows the Aspect to be performed "by others" (the famous piece of advice regarding telling the two apart being that a sentence written in passive voice can have "by zombies" tacked to the end of it - eg, John is attacked "by zombies", as compared to active voice - John attacks).



Princes suffer from a toxic overabundance of Aspect, and are prone to spectacular meltdowns, whereas Bards are always poised for a crisis of faith. Both are responsible for catastrophic failures - but also breathless victories.

The primary character struggle a Knight will have is with crippling insecurity. Knights are prone to self-loathing and imposter syndrome, and will often adopt a façade in direct opposition to their aspect (ie, their fundamental personality) in order to cope with their feelings of inadequacy. Thus, their relationship with their aspect becomes love/hate - though they're naturally drawn to their aspect, and even naturally skilled at utilizing it, they have a tendency to become their own worst enemy, as their insecurities make them push their façades, and their façades distance them from their aspect.

"Controlling their Aspect" means that the Knight has easy access to their Aspect, wielding it like a tool or weapon - for good or for ill; "controlling using their Aspect" is what grants Knights their leadership abilities, able to dictate how others ought to act in accordance with the Knight's Aspect - whether their understanding of their Aspect is high or low, whether their advice is good or bad.

Therefore, at their worst, a Knight will fall prey to their insecurities, retreating into their facades, rejecting their Aspect, which will allow disharmony or misuse of it to proliferate throughout the team. They may even wind up deliberately twisting their Aspect's presence within the team so that they never have to be confronted by it; these distortions ripple outwards and eventually culminate in major catastrophes, all on account of the Knight's negligence.

But at their best, a Knight is a shining beacon and guiding light; when they come to terms with themselves, and allow themselves to be comfortable in their own skin - when they no longer allow themselves to be ruled by their insecurities and anxieties - they ensure that their aspect is harmonious wherever it appears throughout their party, and can wield it expertly as a weapon, as if it were their own flesh and blood.

The Heir's Aspect is practically an independent entity. Being one whom "their Aspect grants them inheritance" refers to how the Heir starts powerful, able to summon their Aspect to perform great, miraculous acts. However, it is highly intuitive and difficult to control. The Heir's challenge lies not in attaining great power, but in attaining control over, and the ability to direct, their existing abilities. Once they do, they can "inherit their Aspect for others" - Heirs become a conduit through which their party can experience their Aspect, making it a usable pool of wealth for them all to draw from. However, because of their comfortable positions, many Heirs end up dallying, finding no pressing need to do so.

A Sylph's main challenge - or rather, the main challenge that Sylphs wind up posing the rest of the party - is that Sylphs are enablers. They're attracted to those with strong wills and extreme dispositions, amused by the havoc they wreak and pleased by their attention. Sylphs love to pick out favorites and lavish them with care and attention, excusing any wrongdoing on their behalf and shielding them from consequences. At the same time, those who don't strike the Sylph's capricious fancy find themselves discarded in the Sylph's mind, shut out from the boons the Sylph can provide.

A Sylph is "one who allows their Aspect to change others" - this almost always manifests as healing, as it's an additive ability (that is to say, the Sylph can grant more of their Aspect to someone). "Changing their Aspect for others," on the other hand, explains this enabling nature of theirs - the Sylph will intervene to make the world into a playground for their favored individuals, even to the point of turning other, less "interesting" teammates into playthings for the Sylph's beloved.

Princes are the most anxious, psychologically anguished members of a party. They suffer from a toxic overabundance of their Aspect - its traits are taken to an extreme, and not only the Prince, but those around them, are made to suffer for it. Princes are naturally set on a path of self-destruction, the culmination of their uncontrolled accumulation of their Aspect, and their meltdowns are spectacular, taking their Aspect - and whoever is unlucky enough to be in the same room - with them.

Thus is the problem with Princes. They're ticking time-bombs of anxiety and frustration; when they finally go off, they carve a path of destruction, before ultimately self-destructing, leaving no trace of their Aspect behind. Not only that, but it's very difficult to defuse the bomb early; Princes have finicky, aggressive, and complicated personalities, and tend to react poorly to straightforward attempts to calm them down and reason with them. They often appear to be their own worst enemies, marching inexorably toward their own destruction.

The point is, Witches are basically rulers of their domain (aspect); what they say, goes. They're the most active class after Lords, and this is no mistake - their powerset is literally to change the world around them to suit themselves better. The catch is, what suits the Witch? What the Witch thinks they want, or what's actually good for them? Learning this lesson, learning how to see beyond themselves, how to set aside personal feelings and unpack their biases, is what the Witch must learn to do, lest they be swayed by dark forces and turn wicked rather than good.

In other words, Sylphs are enablers. In fact, "enabler" is the #1 trait that Hussie associates with Kanaya. He even speculates that her motivation for cutting off Tavros’s legs - which Tavros did not consent to, by the way - was actually one final enabling gift for Vriska.

Princes’ overactive sense of duty and martyr complexes actually coincide with having too much of their aspect. Eridan is burdened by political ideology and societal ideals, and he has too much conviction (AKA he’s an idiot who doesn’t listen to people - Hope traits); Dirk complains about being confronted at every turn with more of himself, and has a massive issue with forcing his persona onto others (Heart and selfhood); Kurloz sews his mouth shut in shame (Rage and self-consciousness).
Obviously, these downward spirals are unsustainable, and so, if nobody knocks the team Prince out of theirs in time, the Prince inevitably has their big, dramatic meltdown, in which they take out their aspect and anyone else unlucky enough to be in the same room. Eridan destroys the trolls’ symbol of Hope, the matriorb, and kicks off murderstuck, symbolically killing hope within the narrative itself (I mean, there’s a reason Jake’s dreamself is the first to die). He actually does this using the power of Hope; fundamentally, his “white science” is, in fact, just magic by another name.
Fundamentally, Dirk hates and fears responsibility, being taken to task for the bad things he’s ACTUALLY done. There are shades of this much sooner, too; he laments to Hal about how much he’s fucked over their friend group, and how shitty he is for avoiding Jane and her birthday party… but then shoots down every suggestion Hal makes that would make it easier for him to go and have that confrontation. He feels bad, but he doesn’t actually want to change anything. It’s the same with his self-loathing - yes, he does HAVE self-loathing, but he doesn’t want to do any work to hate himself less.
So you can see an echo of Eridan in Dirk - like Eridan, Dirk venerates too much the toxic and self-destructive excess of his aspect, even as it actively ruins all his relationships and makes him act in increasingly awful and shitty ways.
He, like Eridan and Kurloz, eventually reaches his breaking point, first with Hal and then with Jake, and he proceeds to do as a Prince does - in a fit of emotions, and wielding his feelings, he proceeds to destroy Jake's self-confidence for the entire rest of the comic.

But why is he so averse to doing this emotional labor? Well, it’s because - contrary to what he says - he’s actually pretty in love with himself. He loves the identity, persona he’s crafted, of being this damaged, troubled, dark and broody guy who’s ready to heroically sacrifice himself at a moment’s notice. It’s very cinematic. And the things that threaten that image, including self-improvement, or entities he’s claimed as part of himself (Hal and Dave) deviating from him… those read to him as hostile actions, threats against his sense of self. If you read carefully, you’ll see that Dirk reacts the worst to Hal when Hal cracks his self-deprecating AI jokes, something Dirk never even comes close to doing, either in style or in substance. Not only are they a symbol of Hal’s deviation from Dirk’s persona, but they’re also thinly-veiled, passive-aggressive, “ironic” commentary Hal is making about how shitty it is to be stuck as a pair of glasses.

In other words, each one is Hal saying, “hey, Dirk, my situation sucks, and you did this to me. You could fix it, you promised you would, and you aren’t.”
