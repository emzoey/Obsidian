# how they could cry / how easily

hunter: easy. at movies. we know this.

josie: easy, too, easier than she and you would think. she hates it and tahts what makes her actually cry, i think, the loathing that she is about to cry at all. the kind of thing where she would get slighted or told that she should have put more effort in (she puts 100% in all the time) and would run to the bathroom and try to stop herself from crying. shes more sensitive than youd think

Fiona: easier than youd think but not as easy as h/j. she compartmentalizes things to think about later (eg, knowing she did something bad to someone that didn't deserve it/her own conscience, being anxious about her plans not working out) and ends up crying about them when she thinks ab them in private. like when shes going to sleep type of thing. if she were to cry in front of people, it would be a cry of desperation. a messy pull your hair out cry

kiv: in the form theyre in now, i think crying is rare. we know this. if they were to cry, itd be after a near miss; being sat shellshocked and raw after just so nearly failing or dying or getting injured and just sitting with it. thats when they can cry. like if they were about to get attacked by a bear and it was about to strike, but was suddenly vaporized, and theyre just sitting there.
and this one is less likely, but the other circumstance may be the rare instance where they get too far into their self-loathing; they would cry, vitriolic, at themselves, how much they hate themselves and their life, knowing that they're so fucked and hopeless and they wish they weren't trans. cry o hate.

eli void and fiona light or flip flopped?? :D

FIRST THOUGHTS:
fiona: heart or light or void or space
- **knight of void**: exploits nothingness/mystery/unawareness for their own use, manipulates ppl. 
	- All that which is unknown, or hidden, obscure or even nonexistent is at their disposal.
	- They can exploit a person’s secrets to either be used against them or exploit how people can sometimes disregard certain things or view them as unimportant. They might worry about whether or not something is truly meaningless or irrelevant. Sometimes they might even wonder if they themselves are truly irrelevant or unimportant in the grand scheme of things.
	- A Knight of Void will struggle finding out what exactly it is they are good at, but once they know what that thing is, nothing can stop them.
	- They would like pull strings from the background and exploit what other people either can’t comprehend or just simply ignore.
- **sylph of heart:**
	- too moral for her but worth a look
- **knight of light**: fears personal lack of knowledge/luck/light?
- HEART ASPECT OMG: Those bound to the aspect of Heart are very concerned with their favorite subject: themselves. It wouldn't be a stretch to call them 'self-obsessed', but not necessarily in a negative way. They simply want to understand the one thing we all are stuck with for our entire lives, i.e. our own minds. Forging an identity is extremely important to the Heart-bound, and every decision and action goes toward building a coherent narrative of their own story. That isn't to say Heart-bound don't care deeply for their friends and allies; they just have a tendency to assume that everyone is as concerned with identity as they are. They are excellent at putting on and taking off masks as the situation calls for them. At their best, they are competent, imaginative, and steady. At their worst they can be overbearing, inflexible, and cold.
eli: void or light or heart. fuck
- **page of heart**
	- Pages of Heart start out with a deficit in Heart and try to overcompensate for it in their attempts to overcome it. So they try to act irrational and impulsive and going by their instincts, but they would either be way off on their instincts of they would follow the wrong impulses, or interpret them wrong.
	- BUT a lot about trying to be compassionate, being too honest, etc
hunter: time or blood or life
kiv: breath or blood or mind
- **bard of blood:** passive destruction of connections/cooperation/stability
	- we already know this, but interesting add'n: Their challenge though is not to be ruled by the whims of their Aspect, but rather to come out of it with a healthy respect and understanding of it. A Bard of Blood that has risen to and came through their challenge will not take their bonds and loyalty, those connected to them, for granted ever again.
josie: rage or doom or life or hope
- **bard of life**: 
	- Their challenge is to not be controlled by the whims of their aspect though and so they must eventually give up or run out of their craved thing and come to accept its absence once again. Maybe they come to terms with death, or sink back into submissive acceptance.
	- They invite the destruction of any kind of luxury, temptation or optimism with their own overwhelming cautious pessimism and repulsion of ever breaking the rules and limits which guide them. They forgo and ignore any other options they have out of fear of reckless unrestriction. A Bard of Life’s crisis would be something like suddenly becoming overwhelmed with reckless temptation for something. They want and crave something so much that they break rules, sacrifice their friends and family, recklessly reaching for what they want
	- They would have very submissive and cautious attitudes, even more so than usual for a Bard, and be extremely non-confrontational. They won’t argue with someone who tells them to do something, they would see it as necessary and quietly accept it. They live their lives fulfilling responsibilities and obligations and very strictly following the rules. They are very quiet and submissive, believing anything different than what they already do to be futile and not worth it. They either feel extremely limited or they place themselves under rules and limits to feel comfortable and safe.
- rogue of rage??
