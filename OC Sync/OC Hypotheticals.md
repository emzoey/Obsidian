# how they could cry / how easily

hunter: easy. at movies. we know this.

josie: easy, too, easier than she and you would think. she hates it and tahts what makes her actually cry, i think, the loathing that she is about to cry at all. the kind of thing where she would get slighted or told that she should have put more effort in (she puts 100% in all the time) and would run to the bathroom and try to stop herself from crying. shes more sensitive than youd think

Fiona: easier than youd think but not as easy as h/j. she compartmentalizes things to think about later (eg, knowing she did something bad to someone that didn't deserve it/her own conscience, being anxious about her plans not working out) and ends up crying about them when she thinks ab them in private. like when shes going to sleep type of thing. if she were to cry in front of people, it would be a cry of desperation. a messy pull your hair out cry

kiv: in the form theyre in now, i think crying is rare. we know this. if they were to cry, itd be after a near miss; being sat shellshocked and raw after just so nearly failing or dying or getting injured and just sitting with it. thats when they can cry. like if they were about to get attacked by a bear and it was about to strike, but was suddenly vaporized, and theyre just sitting there.
and this one is less likely, but the other circumstance may be the rare instance where they get too far into their self-loathing; they would cry, vitriolic, at themselves, how much they hate themselves and their life, knowing that they're so fucked and hopeless and they wish they weren't trans. cry o hate.

eli void and fiona light or flip flopped?? :D

FIRST THOUGHTS:
fiona: heart or light or void or space
- **knight of void**: exploits nothingness/mystery/unawareness for their own use, manipulates ppl. 
	- All that which is unknown, or hidden, obscure or even nonexistent is at their disposal.
	- They can exploit a person’s secrets to either be used against them or exploit how people can sometimes disregard certain things or view them as unimportant. They might worry about whether or not something is truly meaningless or irrelevant. Sometimes they might even wonder if they themselves are truly irrelevant or unimportant in the grand scheme of things.
	- A Knight of Void will struggle finding out what exactly it is they are good at, but once they know what that thing is, nothing can stop them.
	- They would like pull strings from the background and exploit what other people either can’t comprehend or just simply ignore.
eli: void or light or heart. fuck
hunter: time or blood
kiv: breath or blood
josie: rage or doom
