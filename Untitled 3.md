jake, rides on dirks breath, hopeless, limp, a wind-tossed leaf bound for the gutter. 
the erection pressing against his clit's flat head, the slide of jakes tip pressing inside, dirk imagines it in flashes, betrays himself, and honest to god seizes,  inadvertently bucking up and hiking his knees so Jake's body has sunk even deeper between.
"mhm?" jake replies, innocent as ever.
i missed you,  dirk levels, flat, dire. more than i think you would like to know.
jake sighs dreamily. ive been waiting to hear that, love. 
somethinj like a laugh crackles and rises in dirks chest, a bubbled carbonated drink comin back up, and, shit, his cheeks hurt from the strained smile he pulls.
i, ah. jake slides forward, so non subtly pressubg their crotches together  -- dirk appreciates the warmth-- have felt quite the same. and that smile falters and cracks into another delicate eggshell exhale. 
may i?
subtle as possible,  dirk "adjusts to get comfortable" because his dick is itching for any sort of reception here and dirk is depraved,  exploitative,  and shimmies against jake again. the feeling settles and coils again and wraps itself against his stiff cock and dirk has no choice but to breathe out. "fuck it."
he lets jake kiss him. its far more surface than hed like and is terribly dry, but warm and solid in the way a hug is solid.
